When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I was working on a project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If other people have access to that repository for files that I'm not using, I would not want their updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of files from one repository on GitHub to another.  Clones are copies of files from one repository on GitHub to another on a local machine.  Branches are ways of separating different file histories within a repository.
