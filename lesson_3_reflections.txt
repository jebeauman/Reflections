When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I was working on a project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If other people have access to that repository for files that I'm not using, I would not want their updates.
