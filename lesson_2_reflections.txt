What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a .git directory and displays messages to reflect that there is no existing history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Only the files that are to be changed are added to the staging area.  Separating work-in-progress files makes commits easier.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git diff --staged to highlight differences between files in the working directory and files in the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I want to try something new without changing the current file, like a different language, a different level of difficulty, or a different version.  Branches help by allowing the new file to commit while keeping the old file intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They show me how each commit relates to it's neighbors.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The commits for both branches line up on one branch.  The commits on the branch being merged still exist.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
The main advantage is time savings.  The disadvantage is Git doesn't know why a change was made and therefore cannot resolve conflicts.
