Use FC to find bugs
Save old file versions
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The bug was pointed out as the difference between the old (correct) and new (incorrect) versions.

Use history to view old file versions
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By allowing for the tracing of a bug back to its source.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pro is that I can separate changes to logical functions.  The con is that I must remember to do so.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git works with programs whereas Docs works with documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to view the changes in a repository and git diff to view the changes within a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If I make a mistake I can go back to a working version and use git diff to find the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
version control
